<h1>Hello GpuApp</h1>

<p>
  GpuApp is a library for eliminating the gotchas and boilerplate from work
  in the WebGPU.
</p>

<p>
  This is an example space and also expiremental playground to understand the
  confusing parts about the WebGPU API.
</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

More details can be found on github. Each section has a directory with a 
README file, and of course code!

<h3>Background attachment</h3>

When setting up a pipline, you have the option to run a `clear` operation that
will set the background to a color. The color can be transparent, but there are
some gotchas.

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="?page=backgroundAttachmentStatic">Simple background color</a>. It
    includes but doesn't use the shader.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="?page=backgroundAttachmentChanging">Background color that changes per frame</a>.
    It includes but doesn't use the shader.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="?page=backgroundAttachmentWithTriangle">Changing background color with gpu rendered triange</a>,
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Rendering similar background with data passed to the GPU</h3>

You can work around the transparency issues by rendering in a background in the
GPU if you do some unintutive math, premultiplying, in the shader.

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="?page=renderedBackground">GPU rendered background</a>
  </li>
</ul>
